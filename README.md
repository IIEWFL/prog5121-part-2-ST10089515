## How the programs works

This is a Java Swing class that represents the login screen of a Kanban board application. The user can enter their username and password and then click the "LOGIN" button to log in to the application. If the user doesn't have an account, they can click the "Don't Have an Account? Register here." button to be redirected to the registration screen.

The class contains several Swing components such as a JLabel, a JTextField, a JPasswordField, and two JButtons. The initComponents() method initializes these components and sets up their properties such as their text, font, and color.

The loginbtnMouseClicked() method is called when the user clicks on the "LOGIN" button. It reads the username and password entered by the user and then checks if they match the ones stored in a file. If the username and password are correct, it displays a message saying "Login Successful" and redirects the user to the Kanban board screen. If the username and password are incorrect, it displays an error message saying "Invalid Username or Password".

The registerbtnActionPerformed() method is called when the user clicks on the "Don't Have an Account? Register here." button. It redirects the user to the registration screen.
